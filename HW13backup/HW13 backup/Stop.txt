In Defense of Christmas Music in October.Ah, Christmas music! The warm tunes that remind so many of us ofhuddling around a fire surrounded by family.The sounds that remind of pine scents, mistletoe, and holiday cheer.There's so much good feeling attached to Christmas music that it's nice to dipinto the holiday playlists early and get excited about what's to come.
